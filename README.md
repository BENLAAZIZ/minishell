# minishell

In our extensive and critical project within the 42 network, we are tasked with developing a sophisticated command interpreter that emulates the functionality of bash. This minishell will manage environment variables, launch programs, and handle their return values. Additionally, it will include several built-in functions such as **`cd`**, **`echo`**, **`env`**, **`exit`**, **`export`**, **`pwd`**, and **`unset`**. This ambitious and lengthy endeavor is a cornerstone of our curriculum, reflecting the depth and complexity expected in our training.

## builtin functions 


## echo with option -n
## `cd` with only a relative or absolute path

* In C, the functions **`getcwd()`** and **`chdir()`** are used to get and change the current working directory, respectively. These functions are part of the POSIX standard and are commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

1. **getcwd()**
The getcwd() function is used to get the current working directory. It copies an absolute pathname of the current working directory to the buffer provided by the user.

####  **Syntax**
```
char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
```
####  **Parameters**
  
+ **`buf`**: A pointer to an array where the path name will be stored.
+ **`size`**: The size of the array pointed to by buf.
####  **Return Value**
On success, getcwd() returns a pointer to the buffer buf.
On failure, it returns NULL, and errno is set to indicate the error.


#### Example

```Copier le code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <limits.h>  // For PATH_MAX

int main() {
    char buf[PATH_MAX];

    if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(buf)) != NULL) {
        printf("Current working dir: %s\n", buf);
    } else {
        perror("getcwd() error");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
2. **chdir()**
The chdir() function is used to change the current working directory to the directory specified in its argument.

####  **Syntax**
```
int chdir(const char *path);
```
####  **Parameters**
+ **`path`**: A pointer to a string containing the path to the directory to which you want to change.
####  **Return Value**
On success, chdir() returns 0.
On failure, it returns -1, and errno is set to indicate the error.

#### Example
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    const char *newDir = "/path/to/new/dir";

    if (chdir(newDir) == 0) {
        printf("Directory changed to: %s\n", newDir);
    } else {
        perror("chdir() error");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### `env` with no options or arguments:


In Bash, an **`environment`** refers to a set of variables that are used by the operating system to control the behavior of processes. These environment variables can store information such as user preferences, system configurations, and other settings that programs can access to tailor their functionality. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of environment variables in Bash and their typical use cases:


**Environment Variables in Bash**
1. Definition and Structure:

* Environment variables are key-value pairs, where the key is the variable name and the value is the variable's data.
* They are typically written in uppercase letters (e.g., PATH, HOME, USER).
2. Common Environment Variables:

* `PATH`: Specifies the directories in which the shell looks for executable files. For example, when you type a command, Bash searches these directories to find the command.
* `HOME`: Indicates the current user's home directory.
* `USER`: Contains the username of the current user.
* `SHELL`: Indicates the path to the current user's shell.
* `PWD`: Stores the current working directory.
